    "detailed_feedback": {
      "content_analysis": "The content focuses on L1 and L2 regularization, providing concise definitions and distinguishing use cases. However, the presentation lacks a clear structure, with no distinct opening or closing. The absence of examples or context makes the information difficult to grasp for those unfamiliar with the topic. Improving the structure and adding real-world examples would significantly enhance the content's clarity and engagement.",
      "delivery_analysis": "The vocal delivery is generally good, with clear articulation and no filler words. The speaking pace is slightly below the optimal range. Varying vocal tone and emphasis could further enhance the delivery and maintain audience interest. Overall, the delivery is competent but could benefit from increased dynamism.",
      "visual_analysis": "Eye contact is a strong point, indicating engagement with the audience. However, the lack of facial expressions makes the presentation appear monotone and unenthusiastic. Incorporating more natural gestures and improving posture could enhance visual presence and create a more engaging experience for the audience.",
      "tone_analysis": "The dominant emotion is happy, which is generally positive. However, the emotional range is limited, suggesting a lack of variation in tone. Injecting more emotional nuance and authenticity into the delivery could make the presentation more compelling and relatable."
