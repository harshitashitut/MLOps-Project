So, I think my weakness is that I have found that I can get a bit lost in the beginning of any project, like in the details of that project, so usually, now what I do is I give myself a fixed timeline, a fixed window, a day or two to understand the project and point where to begin from and so once I have that outline I pause to share it with my team mates and gather any feedback they have for me so that quick checkpoint makes sure that I'm headed in the right direction before diving into the fine details
