TEST SET — MACHINE LEARNING ROLE


Q: What is regularization in machine learning?
A: Regularization reduces overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. L1 encourages sparsity, while L2 reduces coefficient magnitude. This improves model generalization.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent, concise, and technically accurate.

Q: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.
A: It describes the balance between model complexity and generalization. High bias models underfit, while high variance models overfit. The goal is minimizing total error by choosing an optimal capacity.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Strong conceptual explanation.

Q: What is gradient descent?
A: Gradient descent minimizes a loss function by iteratively updating parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient. Variants like SGD, Adam, and RMSProp improve convergence.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Great detail with variants.

Q: What is cross-validation?
A: Cross-validation splits data into folds, training on some and validating on the remaining. K-fold CV improves reliability of performance estimates and reduces overfitting risks.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Clear and useful.

Q: What is transfer learning?
A: Transfer learning uses pretrained models on related tasks, fine-tuning them for new tasks with less data. It's standard in NLP and vision due to reduced training cost and improved accuracy.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent explanation.

Q: What is overfitting?
A: When a model learns the training data too well and fails on new data.
Structure: 6 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 8 | Overall: 7
Feedback: Correct but needs examples or mitigation strategies.

Q: What is a neural network?
A: A model inspired by the brain with layers of neurons.
Structure: 7 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 7 | Overall: 7
Feedback: Needs more technical depth.

Q: What is a confusion matrix?
A: A table that shows predictions vs actual values.
Structure: 6 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 7 | Overall: 6
Feedback: Should explain TP, FP, FN, TN.

Q: What is feature scaling?
A: Making features have similar ranges.
Structure: 6 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 7 | Overall: 6
Feedback: Needs mention of normalization vs standardization.

Q: What is clustering?
A: Grouping data that is similar.
Structure: 7 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 7 | Overall: 7
Feedback: Could name algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN).

Q: What is regularization?
A: Something that makes models regular.
Structure: 2 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 1 | Overall: 2
Feedback: Not meaningful.

Q: What is gradient descent?
A: When gradients go down a hill.
Structure: 2 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 1 | Overall: 2
Feedback: Metaphor lacks explanation.

Q: What is a neural network?
A: A brain inside a computer.
Structure: 2 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 1 | Overall: 2
Feedback: Inaccurate.

Q: What is cross-validation?
A: Validating something by crossing it.
Structure: 1 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 1 | Overall: 1
Feedback: Wrong and unclear.

Q: What is clustering?
A: When data sticks together.
Structure: 2 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 2 | Overall: 2
Feedback: Too vague.
