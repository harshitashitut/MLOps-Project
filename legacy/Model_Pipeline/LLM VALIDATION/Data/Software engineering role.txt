Software engineering role:


1.

Q: What is the difference between a process and a thread?
A: A process is an independent program with its own memory space, while threads are lightweight execution units within the same process that share memory. Threads allow parallelism with lower overhead, whereas processes provide stronger isolation.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent depth and clarity with correct distinctions.

2.

Q: Explain REST architecture principles.
A: REST is based on stateless communication, uniform interfaces, client-server separation, cacheability, and a layered architecture. Resources are represented with standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Thorough explanation with clear REST principles.

3.

Q: What is multithreading and why is it useful?

Feedback: Excellent summary with precise definitions.

5.

Q: What is a race condition?
A: A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data concurrently and the final outcome depends on execution timing. Proper synchronization (locks, atomics, etc.) is required to prevent it.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Very strong explanation with solution context.

6.

Q: Explain dependency injection.

Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent clarity and practical focus.

7.

Q: What is a deadlock?
A: A deadlock occurs when threads hold resources and wait for others in a circular dependency, preventing progress. Avoidance strategies include lock ordering, timeouts, and minimizing shared state.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Great explanation with prevention strategies.

8.

Q: Explain Big O notation.

Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent conceptual summary.

9.

Q: What happens during a context switch?
A: The CPU saves the state of the running process or thread, loads the state of the next one, and updates internal registers. This enables multitasking but incurs overhead.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Strong explanation capturing key details.

10.

Q: Describe how garbage collection works.
A: Garbage collectors identify unreachable objects, reclaim memory, and compact the heap in some implementations. Algorithms include mark-and-sweep, generational GC, and reference counting.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent technical completeness.

11.

Q: What is a design pattern?
