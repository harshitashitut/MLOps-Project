TEST SET — SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ROLE



Q: What is multithreading?
A: Multithreading allows multiple threads within a process to run concurrently, improving responsiveness in I/O-bound tasks and enabling parallelism.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent technical clarity.



Q: Explain SOLID principles.
A: The SOLID principles guide maintainable software design: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP. They promote decoupling, flexibility, and testability.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Perfect overview.



Q: What is a race condition?
A: A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data without synchronization, causing unpredictable behavior. Locks and atomics prevent it.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Strong explanation.



Q: What is a design pattern?
A: A reusable, proven solution to common software design problems, such as Factory, Singleton, Observer, and Strategy patterns.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Clear with examples.



Q: Explain dependency injection.
A: DI provides required dependencies externally rather than creating them inside a class, improving flexibility and testability.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Accurate and concise.



Q: What is a thread?
A: A lightweight process.
Structure: 7 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 7 | Overall: 7
Feedback: Needs more detail.



Q: What is Git branching?
A: Creating separate lines of code development.
Structure: 6 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 7 | Overall: 6
Feedback: Could mention workflows.



Q: What is a stack?
A: A LIFO structure.
Structure: 7 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 8 | Overall: 7
Feedback: Basic but correct.



Q: What is SQL?
A: A language to manage data in databases.
Structure: 7 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 7 | Overall: 7
Feedback: Needs examples (SELECT, JOIN).


Q: What is caching?
A: Temporarily storing often-used data.
Structure: 6 | Clarity: 7 | Relevance: 8 | Overall: 7
Feedback: Could mention cache invalidation.


Q: What is multithreading?
A: Doing many threads.
Structure: 1 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 1 | Overall: 1
Feedback: Not meaningful.


Q: What is SQL?
A: A software program.
Structure: 2 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 1 | Overall: 2
Feedback: Incorrect.


Q: What is a race condition?
A: Threads racing to finish.
Structure: 2 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 1 | Overall: 2
Feedback: Wrong interpretation.


Q: What is a design pattern?
A: A style pattern in software.
Structure: 2 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 2 | Overall: 2
Feedback: Not accurate.


Q: What is Git?
A: Something used by programmers.
Structure: 2 | Clarity: 2 | Relevance: 2 | Overall: 2
Feedback: Too vague.
