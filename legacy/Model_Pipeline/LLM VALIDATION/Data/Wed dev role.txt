Wed dev role:

1.

Q: What is the DOM?
A: The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of the structure of an HTML document. JavaScript can use the DOM API to manipulate elements, attributes, and styles dynamically.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent accuracy and explanation of purpose.

2.

Q: Explain the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML.
A: Block-level elements occupy the full available width and start on a new line (e.g., <div>, <p>). Inline elements only take up the width of their content and do not break the flow (e.g., <span>, <a>).
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Very clear with correct examples.

3.

Q: What is the purpose of CSS Flexbox?
A: Flexbox provides a layout system optimized for single-axis alignment, allowing flexible spacing, ordering, and alignment of elements within a container.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Strong explanation highlighting purpose and benefits.

4.

Q: Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript.
A: Synchronous code blocks the thread until each operation completes, while asynchronous code uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to run non-blocking operations, improving responsiveness.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent explanation with proper concepts.

5.

Q: What are web components?
A: Web components are reusable custom elements built using the Shadow DOM, HTML templates, and custom element APIs. They encapsulate styles and logic for portability.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 9
Feedback: Very strong; could add an example use case.

6.

Q: What is responsive design?
A: Responsive design adapts layouts to different screen sizes using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to ensure usability across devices.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Perfectly described.

7.

Q: Explain how HTTP works.
A: HTTP is a stateless request–response protocol where clients send requests and servers reply with resources or status codes. Versions like HTTP/2 support multiplexing and header compression for performance.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent depth for an interview.

8.

Q: What is event bubbling in JavaScript?
A: Event bubbling means an event triggered on a child element propagates upward through the ancestor elements. You can stop it using event.stopPropagation().
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Clear, correct, and complete.

9.

Q: Explain CORS.
A: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security mechanism that restricts requests from different origins unless the server explicitly allows them via headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Great explanation with key header detail.

10.

Q: What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?
A: An SPA dynamically updates content using JavaScript without reloading the page, often relying on frameworks like React or Vue and using client-side routing.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent and concise.

11.

Q: What is the difference between cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage?
A: Cookies are small key–value pairs sent with every HTTP request. localStorage persists indefinitely, while sessionStorage persists only for the page session and isn't sent to the server.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Covers the fundamental differences clearly.

12.

Q: How does the browser rendering pipeline work?
A: The browser parses HTML into a DOM, parses CSS into a CSSOM, combines them into a render tree, calculates layout, and paints pixels. Reflows and repaints occur when styles or layout change.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent technical breakdown.

13.

Q: What is debouncing?
A: Debouncing delays the execution of a function until after a specified waiting period has passed since the last trigger, reducing unnecessary calls—for example, during input events.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 9 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 9
Feedback: Clear explanation with practical context.

14.

Q: What is JSX?
A: JSX is a syntax extension in React that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript, which transpiles into React.createElement calls.
Structure: 10 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Very accurate and concise.

15.

Q: What is webpack?
A: Webpack is a module bundler that processes and bundles JavaScript, CSS, images, and other assets. It supports loaders, plugins, code splitting, and tree shaking.
Structure: 9 | Clarity: 10 | Relevance: 10 | Overall: 10
Feedback: Excellent coverage of core features.
