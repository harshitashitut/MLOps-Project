Hi, my name is Khushi Vakil, I'm currently pursuing my masters in computer science at northeastern university. I have experience building ML models and the pipelines behind it. I have worked with pytorch, docker, ML flow and AWS to train, version and deploy models reliably, recently i have been working on a project which uses BERT based classifier on reddit dataset to depression classification.
