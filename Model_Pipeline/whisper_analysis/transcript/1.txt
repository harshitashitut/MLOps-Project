The bias–variance tradeoff describes how model complexity affects prediction error.

A High bias means model is too simple, underfits, high training and test error.
where as 
a High variance means model is too complex, overfits, low training error but high test error.
The goal is to find a balance using techniques like cross-validation, regularization, or adjusting model capacity.
