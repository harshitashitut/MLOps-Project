So I am someone who like to plan ahead by breaking my project into clear steps, each with its own deadline, and a little extra breathing room, that way when I am facing any unexpected issue, I'm not scrambling and I can just shift my tasks around and still deliver my requirements on time. So by giving myself that flexibility, I keep my teams momentum going and I avoid going any last minute stress.
