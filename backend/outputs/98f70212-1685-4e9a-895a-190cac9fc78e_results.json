    "detailed_feedback": {
      "content_analysis": "The content demonstrates strong clarity in identifying a problem and proposing a practical solution, showcasing a logical progression of ideas. The message is highly focused on self-management and team collaboration in project initiation. However, the opening is weak, failing to immediately engage the audience. There's a repetitive use of 'So' and a general lack of vivid language or rhetorical devices, which diminishes emotional appeal and memorability. To enhance content quality, focus on crafting a compelling introduction and diversifying vocabulary to make the message more impactful and engaging.",
      "delivery_analysis": "Your vocal delivery maintains a near-optimal speaking pace, which contributes to good comprehensibility. However, there is a noticeable frequency of filler words, particularly 'So' and 'like', which can distract the listener and reduce perceived confidence. Articulation also appears to be an area for improvement, suggesting that some words may not be pronounced with full clarity. While volume consistency was not directly measured, addressing filler words and articulation will significantly enhance the professionalism and impact of your vocal delivery.",
      "visual_analysis": "The visual presentation requires significant attention. The overall visual score is low, primarily due to a lack of gestures and facial expressiveness, which are crucial for conveying engagement and dynamism. Posture is moderate, but eye contact, while present, could be more consistent. Critically, the camera orientation and framing issues detected suggest that the audience may not have a full view of your body language, hindering your ability to communicate effectively non-verbally. Improving these aspects will greatly enhance your presence and professionalism.",
      "tone_analysis": "The vocal emotion analysis indicates a dominant 'fearful' emotion, which may not be entirely appropriate for the context of discussing a personal weakness and a solution. While your vocal confidence is moderate, the emotional distribution suggests a somewhat flat delivery, lacking strong, purposeful emotional shifts. To improve, focus on aligning your emotional tone with the message you intend to convey, aiming for more confidence, determination, or neutrality when discussing challenges and solutions, thereby enhancing authenticity."
