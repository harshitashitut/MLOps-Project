  "detailed_feedback": {
    "content_analysis": "The speech effectively states the project goal and is concise, which are commendable strengths. However, it suffers from a weak opening and an abrupt ending, failing to capture audience attention or provide a strong conclusion. The content, while technically focused, lacks depth and engaging elements such as storytelling or broader context, making it less accessible and impactful for a general audience. Expanding on the 'why' and 'impact' of the project would significantly enhance its quality.",
    "delivery_analysis": "The speaker maintains good articulation and minimal filler word usage, which are significant strengths contributing to clarity. However, the speaking pace is notably slow (106.6 WPM), which can affect audience engagement and the overall energy of the presentation. There's an opportunity to vary vocal tone and pace to emphasize key points and maintain listener interest, preventing monotony.",
    "visual_analysis": "Direct eye contact is a strong point, indicating confidence and engagement with the audience. However, facial expressiveness is severely lacking, which can make the speaker appear disengaged or unenthusiastic. Posture and gestures are moderate, suggesting room for more purposeful and open body language to enhance visual communication and presence. Improving these aspects would create a more dynamic and professional visual impression.",
    "tone_analysis": "The analysis indicates a dominant emotion of 'disgust', which is highly inappropriate for a professional presentation and can negatively impact audience perception. While vocal confidence is moderate, the overall emotional tone needs significant adjustment to convey enthusiasm, neutrality, or a more positive sentiment aligned with the topic. Ensuring emotional appropriateness is crucial for connecting with the audience and maintaining credibility."
