  "detailed_feedback": {
    "content_analysis": "The speech demonstrates a clear focus on the project and its technical details, which is a strong point for clarity. However, the overall structure is weak, lacking a compelling opening to hook the audience and an effective closing to summarize key takeaways. The content depth is insufficient for a comprehensive presentation, and the use of technical jargon without adequate explanation may alienate a general audience, leading to low engagement. Developing a more narrative flow with supporting examples would significantly enhance the message's impact.",
    "delivery_analysis": "Your vocal delivery is characterized by good articulation, ensuring your words are generally clear. However, the speaking pace of 106.6 words per minute is quite slow, falling below the optimal range and potentially affecting audience engagement. The presence of filler words, though not excessive, indicates moments of hesitation. Improving pace and reducing fillers by practicing deliberate pauses will make your delivery more dynamic and confident. Volume consistency is adequate, but varying your vocal tone could add more emphasis and interest.",
    "visual_analysis": "Your eye contact is a significant strength, showing good connection with the audience and contributing to a confident presence. You also exhibit no detectable nervous habits. However, there is a notable absence of gestures and facial expressiveness, which makes the visual presentation appear static and less engaging. While posture is acceptable, incorporating more dynamic body language and appropriate facial expressions would greatly enhance your overall visual communication and professionalism.",
    "tone_analysis": "The dominant emotion detected, 'fearful,' is inappropriate for a technical project update and can undermine your message's credibility. The emotional distribution is quite flat, suggesting a limited range of expression and potentially a lack of authenticity in conveying the subject matter. While your vocal confidence is moderate, aligning your emotional tone with the professional and informative nature of your content is crucial for effective communication and audience connection."
