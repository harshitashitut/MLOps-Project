      "content_analysis": "The content demonstrates a good understanding of the problem and a practical approach to addressing it. The structure is adequate, but the opening and closing are weak and lack impact. The message is generally clear, but could benefit from more specific examples to illustrate the points being made. Engagement could be improved by using more compelling language and storytelling techniques.",
      "delivery_analysis": "The vocal delivery is generally adequate. The speaking pace is slightly below the optimal range. The articulation could be improved. The use of filler words is noticeable and detracts from the overall delivery. Varying the tone and pace more would increase engagement.",
      "visual_analysis": "The visual presentation is fair. Eye contact is a strength. Posture and gestures are adequate. Facial expressiveness is lacking, which makes the presentation appear flat and unengaging. Work on conveying emotions through facial expressions to connect better with the audience.",
      "tone_analysis": "The dominant emotion detected was anger, which is not appropriate for the context. The speaker needs to be more aware of their tone and strive for a more neutral and positive delivery. Confidence is moderate, and authenticity is good."
