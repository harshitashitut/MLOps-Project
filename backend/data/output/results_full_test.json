    "detailed_feedback": {
      "content_analysis": "The content presented definitions of L1 and L2 regularization but lacked a broader context or introductory remarks. While the distinctions between the two methods were clear, the absence of examples or supporting evidence weakened the overall impact. The abrupt ending further detracted from the presentation's effectiveness, leaving the audience without a sense of closure or actionable takeaways.",
      "delivery_analysis": "The vocal delivery was generally clear and articulate, with a good articulation score. The speaking pace was slightly below the optimal range, which could impact audience engagement. The absence of filler words is a positive aspect. However, volume consistency could be improved for a more engaging presentation.",
      "visual_analysis": "Eye contact was a strong point, indicating good audience engagement. However, facial expressiveness was notably lacking, which could make the presentation appear monotone and unenthusiastic. Gestures could be more frequent and purposeful to enhance visual communication. Posture was adequate but could be improved for a more confident presence.",
      "tone_analysis": "The dominant emotion detected was anger, which is inappropriate for an informative presentation. This could stem from the vocal confidence being perceived as aggressive. It's important to consciously moderate the emotional tone to convey information in a neutral and objective manner."
